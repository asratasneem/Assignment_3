-Pandas
-gzip

## Description
-With PTT [like Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus Subtilis, Halobacterium, Synechocystis] and GFF [ld 2088090036) ]files, the program attempts to predict operons, which are defined as contiguous multi-gene transcriptional units, inside designated genomes and a crop microbiome from Hoatzin. 
-Using the condition that adjacent co-directional genes within 50 bp are regarded as part of the same operon, it parses these files to extract gene positions and directions. 
-The algorithm predicted operons for the Hoatzin microbiome with parsing PTT files and gff file, highlighting the need for careful data handling.
